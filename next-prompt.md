A high-conversion premium Landing Page for SpeakMate.

**DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED):**
Use a sleek dark mode theme with Midnight Onyx backgrounds and Electric Indigo accents. Implement glassmorphism for all cards and panels (frosted glass textures). Ensure all buttons are pill-shaped. Focus on a high-end AI aesthetic.

**Page Structure:**
1. **Header:** Minimalist logo, "Features," "Pricing," "FAQ" links, and a "Get Started" pill-shaped button.
2. **Hero Section:** "Master English Speaking with your AI Buddy." A large, glowing headline with a subtext: "Real-time feedback, natural conversations, and personalized learning paths."
3. **Primary CTA:** A large "Start Practicing for Free" button with a pulsing Electric Indigo glow.
4. **Social Proof:** "Trusted by 50,000+ learners worldwide" with a row of subtle minimalist logos.
5. **Feature Grid:** Three glassmorphism cards showing:
    - **Real-time Feedback:** "Get instant grammar and pronunciation corrections."
    - **Natural Conversations:** "Talk to an AI that sounds and feels like a native speaker."
    - **Progress Tracking:** "Monitor your improvement with detailed analytics."
6. **Footer:** Simple links, social icons, and copyright.
